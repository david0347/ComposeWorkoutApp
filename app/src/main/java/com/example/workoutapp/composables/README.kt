****If you would like to have starter variables inserted in the database go to MainActivity and
uncomment all the routine and codes inside of the paragraph comment****

David Duh-
This project was created for CSC 487 and I utilize many different elements
such as an SQL Database, Room database, coroutines(multithreading), kotlin language,
jetpack compose, lazy rows, and columns and more

As long as the app is used as intended I believe I fixed all of the bugs and
most of the bugs I did fix surrounded coroutines and where they were located in the code.
Since they function asynchronously, the traditional top down code does not work as intended

If I had more time I would add a drop down to choose the day of the week in create new routine.
I would also add some charts to show data in different ways. I do like the way statistics page
looks, but a chart would be cool

My biggest take away was learning how coroutines work and making sure they are outside of the page
loading. I got good at lazy rows/columns and I got to understand better how a database works
in the backend. It was my first time creating a multi-tabled database and it worked quite well.
Suspend functions and the syntax of coroutines is now second nature and I can progress on these
ideas to make cooler apps in the future
